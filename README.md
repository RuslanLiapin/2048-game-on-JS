# 2048

    - [DEMO LINK](https://ruslanliapin.github.io/2048-game-on-JS/)

The project is a web-based implementation of the popular game 2048. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the game interface and logic. The game involves merging tiles with the same number by moving them in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The objective is to reach the tile with the number 2048.

The project includes the following components:

HTML structure: The game interface is built using HTML, including the game board and score display.
CSS styling: The game interface is styled using CSS to enhance the visual appeal and provide a user-friendly experience.
JavaScript logic: The game logic is implemented using JavaScript. It includes functions for generating random tiles, merging tiles, moving tiles in different directions, checking game over conditions, updating the score, and handling user input.
Event handling: User input is captured using event listeners for keyboard keys and a button click event to start/restart the game.
Game state management: The current state of the game, including the positions and values of tiles, is stored in a multidimensional array.
Game flow: The game progresses as the user makes valid moves. Tiles are merged, the score is updated, and random tiles are generated after each move. The game ends when the game board is full and no further moves can be made, or when the target tile with the number 2048 is reached.
The project provides an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience, challenging players to strategize and make the best moves to achieve high scores. It can be accessed and played directly in a web browser.
